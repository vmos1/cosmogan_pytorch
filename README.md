# Introduction
Code to implement Generative Adversarial Neural networks to produce images of matter distribution in the universe for different sets of cosmological parameters. Dataset consisits of N-body cosmology simulations. The code is built using the python framework.
The aim is to build conditional GANs to produce images for different classes corresponding to different sets of cosmological parameters.
